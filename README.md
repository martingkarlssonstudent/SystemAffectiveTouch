# SystemAffectiveTouch
A System for Affective Touch
The ikaros folder contains the code for generating data and producing predictions from touch, correpsonding to the Ikaros setup.
The tfgraph folder contains a Tensforflow graph from a Tensorflow ANN, which is referenced in class MLExt.cc.
The Arduino folder contains the Arduino IDE file used as interface for the Bare Conductive touchboard.
Sosy_ANN_SL_Touch_Data_Tests_Optimization_CSV.ipynb is the Tensorflow project in Google Colab. It reads a CSV file and proudces learning and evaluation for ANN and SVM models, 
an optimization thereof and an export of the ANN grpah objects.
